\section{Introduction}
This paper represents natural prosecution of the previous work ''Memory effects in news' spreading networks'' by the same authors.
While the first explained network's structure and its main functionalities, this one investigates possible relationships between agents' memory and some network's statistical properties.
Precisely, we will measure, with various levels of memory, gini index of news' distribution, clustering and diameter.
After indicating a precise measurement procedure, a regression and a phenomenological description will be provided for each one of them.
