\section{Introduction}
Abstract
This paper represents natural prosecution of the previous work,
''Memory effects in news' spreading networks'' by the same authors.\\
Network's structure and the software codes were
formerly explained: now we will pay particular attention to
the connection between agents' memory length  and some of the
network's statistical properties.
Furthermore we will measure the \hl{Gini index} of news' distribution,
clustering and diameter over different memory sizes.\\
We will point out a precise measurement procedure based on non-linear
regression; then we will suggest a phenomenological description of
each of the measured quantities.\\ \\
In the first section we will point out the relations between memory size
and user's behaviour. \\ \\
In the second section the focus will be on the network.\\ \\
Does memory size have something connected with other properties?
we belive yes and we are expecting to find some correlations related
to information, spreading and entropy. Thus the use of Gini.\\ \\
Does a phenomenological approach make sense? \hl{Yes because abm needs
this type of approach (vedi slides)}\\ \\
Is this model validated with real data? \hl{Not yet.}
