\subsection{Diameter}
In graph theory, \textit{shortest path} (SP) between node $a$ and $b$ of a graph is the minimum number of links connecting them (i.e. the minimum number of ``steps'' to go from $a$ to $b$).
After computing SP for every couple of nodes in a graph, we can define \textit{diameter} as the maximum of the shortest paths.\\
As with clustering, we have run out several simulations for every memory level, obtaining a diameter's mean-memory plot with standard deviations as errorbars. Final regression will point out possible correlations.
