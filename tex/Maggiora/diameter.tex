\subsection{Diameter}
In graph theory, shortest path (SP) between node $a$ and $b$ of a graph is the minimum number of links connecting them (i.e. the minimum number of ``steps'' to go from $a$ to $b$).
After computing SP for every couple of nodes in a graph, we can define diameter as the maximum of the shortest paths.
As with clustering, we have run out a simulation for every memory level, obtaining a diameter-memory plot. Final regression will point out possible correlations.
