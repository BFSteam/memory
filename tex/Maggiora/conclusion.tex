\section{Conclusion and further developments}
This paper has shown a correlation between memory length and Gini index of news' distribution: 
a suitable optimization function was developed in order to properly fit experimental data.
With reference to network topology, memory does not significantly affect clustering and diameter.\\
Bubble chambers are fully observed for small lengths of mental state vector (lower than number of nodes
in the network at least).\\
Further developments include longer simulations with more nodes:  the overall system is not in general 
scale-invariant. Hence, we expect different beahviours at higher orders of magnitude.\\
In addition, other agents' actions or news' features could be added for a better realism.
For example, news are characterized by a certain amount of different topics.\\
However, they are not perceived as bad or good by agents: this additional ``degree of freedom'' 
could be inserted in the algorithm.
