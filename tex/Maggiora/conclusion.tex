\section{Conclusion and further developments}
This paper has shown a correlation between memory length and Gini
index of news' distribution: a suitable optimization function
was developed in order to properly fit experimental data.
With reference to network topology, memory does not significantly
affect clustering and diameter.
There is not, at the moment, a clear evidence of echo chambers.\\
\\
Further developments include longer simulations with more nodes:
the overall system is not generally scale-invariant.
Hence, we expect different behaviors (like a more
distinct observation
of echo chambers) at higher orders of magnitude.\\
In addition, other agents' actions or news' features could be added for a better realism.
For example, news are characterized by a certain amount of different topics.\\
However, they are not perceived as bad or good by agents: this additional ``degree of freedom''
could be inserted in the algorithm.
