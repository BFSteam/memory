\section{Effects on Users} \label{sec:users}
Memory selects the amount of news can be remembered: this could
affect news' distribution among users.
Indeed, if we insert in the network a certain number of news
(i.e. launching a simulation with many news), they will reach a
fraction of users (\textit{FOUR}, fraction of users reached)
at a fixed time.\\
News spreading over time, in general, starts with a fluctuating
transient and then reaches a stationary state: from a ``microscopic''
point of view, users' identity might vary but the fraction is
pretty much the same. \\
It is statistically correct to compute, for every news, the average
\textit{FOUR} over time, with a certain threshold in order to
neglect the transient (the end time and the threshold are
experimentally determined by free trials).
We obtain in this  way a distribution of average \textit{FOURs},
one for each news.\\
