\section{Effects on Users} \label{sec:users}
Every user can store a maximum amount of  news, i.e. has a memory: this distinctive trait could affect news' distribution among users.
Indeed, if we insert in the network a certain number of news
(i.e. launching a simulation with many news), they will reach a
fraction of users (\textit{FOUR}, fraction of users reached)
at a fixed time.
\footnote{20 news for all of our simulations.}\\
News spreading over time, in general, starts with a fluctuating
transient and then reaches a stationary state: from a ``microscopic''
point of view, users' identity might vary but the fraction is
pretty much the same. \\
It is statistically correct to compute, for every news, the average
\textit{FOUR} over time, with a given threshold in order to
neglect the transient.\footnote{The end time and the threshold are
  experimentally determined by free trials. Moreover, threshold is
  not statistically significant since the end time was several orders of magnitude higher.}
Proceding this way, we obtain a distribution of average \textit{FOURs}
for each news.\\
