\section{Effects on Users} \label{sec:users}
Every user can store a maximum amount of news, i.e. has a memory: this
distinctive trait could affect news' distribution among users.
As a matter of fact, if we insert in the network a certain number
of news (i.e. launching a simulation with some news),
they will reach a fraction of users, at a fixed time:
we will refer to as \textit{fraction of users reached} (FOUR)
from now on.
\footnote{20 news for all of our simulations.}\\
News spreading over time, in general, starts with a fluctuating
transient and then reaches a stationary state: from a ``microscopic''
point of view, users' identity might vary but the fraction is
pretty much the same.\\
It is statistically correct to compute, for every news, the average
FOUR over time, with a given threshold in order to
neglect the transient.\footnote{The end time and the threshold are
  experimentally determined by free trials. Moreover, threshold is
  not statistically significant since the end time was several
  orders of magnitude higher.}
Proceeding this way, we obtain a distribution of average FOURs
for each news.\\
