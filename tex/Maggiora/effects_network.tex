\section{Effects on the network}
All agents in our network have a fixed \textit{memory length}, i.e.
they can remember a maximum amount of news;
in this section, memory length influence in network topology,
will be studied.\\
Clustering and diameter are standard measures in network science's
literarure and widely used to describe network properties.
Each of them will be plotted against memory length looking for
possible correlations.
