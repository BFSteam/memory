\section{Effects on the network}
All agents in our network have a fixed \textit{memory length}, i.e.
they can remember a maximum amount of news;
in this section the influence of memory length in network topology
will be studied.\\
Clustering and diameter are standard measures in network science's
literature and widely used to describe network properties.
Each of them will be plotted over memory length looking for
possible correlations.
