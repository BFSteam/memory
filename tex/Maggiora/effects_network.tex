\section{Effects on the network}
All agents in our network have a fixed \textit{memory length}, i.e. they can remember a maximum
 amount of news.
In this section, its influence in network topology will be studied: clustering and
 diameter are standard measures in network science's literarure and widely used to describe
 network properties.\\
  Each of them will be plotted
 against memory length to search possible correlations.
