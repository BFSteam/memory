\subsection{Clustering} \label{clustering}
A large number of networks show a tendency for link formation
between neighboring vertices, i.e., the network topology deviates
from uncorrelated random networks: this tendency is called
\textit{clustering}.\cite{clusterarticle}\\
For unweighted graphs, the clustering of a node $u$ is the fraction
of possible triangles over all possible triplets
through that node that exist,\cite{clustersite}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:clustering}
c_u = \frac{2 T(u)}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1)}
\end{equation}
where $T(u)$ is the number of triangles through node $u$ and $deg(u)$ is the degree of $u$.
Hence, the \textit{average clustering coefficient}  is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:averageclustering}
ACC = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{v \in G} c_v
\end{equation}
We ask wether memory, previously considered in section
\ref{introduction}, could affect the average clustering coefficient.
To answer the question, the following experiment was designed:
for every memory size, five simulations were run over a thousand
iterations; $ACC$'s mean and standard deviation were computed
afterwards.\\
Finally, via weighted interpolation, a plot of $ACC$'s mean
over memory size will show possible  correlations.
Results and discussion are reported in section \nameref{diameter}.
