\subsection{Clustering}
Clustering is the tendency of a network to cluster, i.e. to divide itself into highly connected groups of nodes.
For unweighted graphs, the clustering of a node $u$ is the fraction of possible triangles over all possible triplets  through that node that exist,

$$
c_u = \frac{2 T(u)}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1)}
$$
where $T(u)$ is the number of triangles through node $u$ and $deg(u)$ is the degree of $u$.
Hence, the average clustering coefficient  is:
$$
ACC = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{v \in G} c_v
$$
We ask wether memory, previously considered in section 1, could affect the average clustering coefficient.
To answer the question, the following experiment was designed:
for every memory level, a simulation was run out until a fixed amount of time; ACC was computed afterwards.\\
Finally, via regression,  ACC-memory plot will show possible correlations.
