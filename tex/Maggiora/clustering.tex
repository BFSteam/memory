\subsection{Clustering}
Clustering is the tendency of a network to cluster, i.e. to divide itself into highly connected groups of nodes.
For unweighted graphs, the clustering of a node u is the fraction of possible triangles over all possible triplets  through that node that exist,

$$
c_u = \frac{2 T(u)}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1)}
$$
where T(u) is the number of triangles through node u and deg(u) is the degree of u.
Hence, the average clustering coefficient is:
$$
C = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{v \in G} c_v
$$
