  \noindent Agent-based models (ABM) have been widely applied for complex systems
  modeling.
  A set of microscopic rules define agent's autonomous and
  cooperative actions: at a macroscopic level, the overall system
  exhibits the so-called ``emergent behavior''.
  Rumor spreading in networks is a natural environment where ABM
  could explain complex phenomena like echo chambers.
  Agents' memory is not generally taken into account by ABM
  literature: we do consider it in our analysis.
  As a starting point, we will rely on our previous work,
  ``Memory effects in news' spreading networks''.\\
  We developed a network framework where agents interact with themselves.
  Network's structure and the software codes were
  formerly explained: now we will pay particular attention to
  the connection between agents' memory length  and some of the
  network's statistical properties.
  Precisely we will measure, over different memory sizes, average
  clustering coefficient, diameter of the network and Gini index
  of news' distribution.\\
  We will define a measurement procedure based on weighted
  regression; then we will suggest a phenomenological description for
  each of the measured quantities.
  In addition, a qualitative study of echo chambers phenomenon is provided.
