Memory selects the amount of news can be remembered: this could affect news' distribution among users.
Indeed, if we insert in the network a certain number of news (i.e. launching a simulation with many news), they will reach a fraction of users (\textit{FOUR}, fraction of users reached) at a fixed time.\\
News spreading over time, in general, starts with a fluctuating transient and then reaches a stationary state: from a ``microscopic'' point of view, users' identity might vary but the fraction is pretty much the same. \\
It is statistically correct to compute, for every news, the average \textit{FOUR} over time, with a certain threshold in order to neglect the transient ( the end time and the threshold are experimentally determined by free trials).
We obtain in this  way a distribution of average \textit{FOURs}, one for each news.\\
\textit{Gini index} measures the inequality of a distribution. Values of 0 and 1 stand for, respectively, the maximum homogeneity and the maximum heterogeneity.
However, this index is a function of random values: mean and error have to be estimated.\\
A certain number of samples is created by sampling with replacement of the average \textit{FOUR} distribution: \textit{Gini index} is computed for each one of them.
Now we have a population of \textit{Gini indexes}, and we can extract mean and error: the whole process is known as \textit{bootstrap} (see Appendix 1 for error estimation).\\
In practical terms, for every level of  memory, a simulation with twenty news is run out: \textit{Gini index}' mean and error are computed like before.
The \textit{Gini index-memory plot} shows a highly non-linear behaviour: sigmoid and gaussian seem to better represent data.\\
 In order to select the best-fit function, \textit{Chi-square} is computed for both of them. \\
Because of asymmetric error bars, the optimization function is slightly different from the standard one, used for weighted interpolation: see Appendix 2 for more details.
Interpolation results are shown below:
