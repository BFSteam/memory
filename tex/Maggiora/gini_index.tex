\subsection{Gini Index}
\textit{Gini index}\cite{ginindex} measures the inequality of a
distribution. Values of 0 and 1 stand for, respectively, the
maximum homogeneity and the maximum heterogeneity.
However, this index is a function of random values: mean and
error have to be estimated.\\
A certain number of samples is created by sampling with replacement
of the average FOUR distribution: Gini index is computed for each
one of them.
Now we have a population of Gini indexes, and we can extract
mean and error: the whole process is known as
\textit{bootstrap}.\footnote{See \nameref{Appendix A} for error estimation.}\cite{bootstrap}\\
In practical terms, for every level of  memory, a simulation with
twenty news is run out: Gini index' mean and error are computed
like before.
The Gini index-memory plot shows a highly non-linear behaviour:
sigmoid and gaussian seem to better represent data.\\
In order to select the best-fit function, \textit{Chi-square} is
computed for both of them. \\
Because of asymmetric error bars, the optimization function is
slightly different from the standard one, used for weighted
interpolation.\footnote{See \nameref{Appendix B} for more details.}
The overall results are shown below:

We can notice that, for every type of errorbar, sigmoid's
$\chi^2$ is slightly lower than gaussian one; p-value is
higher instead.
Null hypothesis, for both measures, is far from being rejected:
goodness-of-fit is solidly validated.
Furthermore, sigmoid function would suggest a phase transition in news' distribution.
This behaviour is not new in network science:  the presence of a giant component in random graphs exhibits a sharp dependence from average degree $\langle k \rangle$.
A giant component is defined as a connected component of a random graph that contains a finite fraction of nodes.\cite{giantwiki}
There are three regimes: subcritical ( $\langle k \rangle <1$), supercritical ( $\langle k \rangle >1$), and connected ( $\langle k \rangle >> ln(N)$, N the total number of nodes).\cite{giantbar} If we start from zero and gradually increase value of $\langle k \rangle$, giant component arises at the critical point $\langle k \rangle =1$.
Analogously, memory length could select different regimes for news' distribution, although further studies would be necessary.
For these reasons, sigmoid is our best-fit function for gini index-memory
length plot.
