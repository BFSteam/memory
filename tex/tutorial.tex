Tutorial
Let's see in practice what we  have previously learnt in a simple tutorial: first of all, we need the whole program, available at https://github.com/BFSteam/memory.
Once we put it in the same folder containing SLAPP3, we need to connect the two programs inserting memory \textbackslash src path in  SLAPP3 \textbackslash project.txt as described in  slapp3 pdf reference handbook, page ...
Now, inside SLAPP3, we can run the program runShell.py, for example by terminal.
In the very beginning, we confirm memory path and project.
